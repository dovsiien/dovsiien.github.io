                <p class="font-weight-bold text-center mb-5" style="font-size: 20px;"> In this project we are in groups
                    of two created a website for the e-book shop both in terms of design and coding. The requirements
                    for this project was to create a fully functional responsive version of site. The process of doing
                    this project contained working with graphics, layouts typography, visual design, thus, making it an
                    UI project. Besides, HTML and CSS were used for coding part.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3"> The process began with consolidated version of style guides we had created previously
                    in this course. As well as, setting up the GitKraken environment as we began using it for a better
                    collaboration process.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3"> The second stage was coming up with the structure of the website which should have
                    contained all the components required for the final version. Here, we did work on the layout of all
                    the pages and connecting them to each other while all the pages were to be ready for the following
                    content to be inserted. Also, we worked on its; responsiveness from the very beginning. The issue
                    encountered here was to create a structure to be appropriate for all the content needed to be on the
                    website. We solved it by sketching different layouts and decided on the one to be the most optimal
                    one.

                </video>

                <p class="mb-5 mt-1"> Third stage was dedicated to collect all the necessary content for the website
                    such as images, text and within-content and integrate it into the pages. Aldo, the main part of this
                    stage was styling the website and we heavily worked on css code and overall design of the webpage.
                    The difficulty encountered during this stage was the responsiveness of all the content integrated
                    which we spent a lot of time fixing.

                <video width="100%" controls autoplay class="mb-5">
                    <source src="3.mov" type="video/mp4">
                </video>

                <p class="mb-4 mt-5"> The final stage was testing and refining the website and finishing small unworking
                    technical and design decisions. During this stage we worked on the consistency of the whole design
                    and testing it on different browsers.

                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-5" style="font-size: 20px;"> Overall, this project was very useful in
                    context of getting more experience in web development and UI design containing working with
                    responsiveness and learning different coding solutions. Due to this project I became more fluent
                    with HTML/CSS coding as well as using of Flexbox in them. And acquired more experience in terms of
                    web development. </p>
